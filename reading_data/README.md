# Reading Data

This is a file I used to learn how to read data. This is made by me, and this is my first Machine Learning File.

I am still learning Python Machine Learning, so this area will be updated frequently.

There is an IRIS.csv file attatched to the Reading Data folder, because I used it for the python file.
